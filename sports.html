   <p>Siegfried Hall has an illustrious history of inter-hall sports championships. Since there are 29 resident halls on campus, 15 of which are male, many intramural sports are played on an inter-hall level. Halls enter one or more teams in seventeen sports, earning points for participation and finishing in the top four in each sport. The grand prize of inter-hall sports is the coveted All Sports Trophy. Siegfried won the trophy for the 2007-2008, 2008-2009, 2009-2010, 2010-2011, 2012-2013 school years.
   <br><br>
   Residents sign up to receive information for as many or as few sports as they would like during the first week of classes. Team captains then stay in touch with interested residents before submitting final rosters a month before play starts. Below you can find the various sports Siegfried participates in, a brief description of the event, and Siegfried's championship success listed in parentheses.

  <h1>Other Athletic Opportunities</h1>

  Throughout the year, Notre Dame hosts other athletic opportunities. There are events such as the Biathlon (half mile swim and two mile run in early September), Domer Run (5 and 10K races in late September), and the Holy Half Marathon (13.1 mile run in late March) and various 5K races sponsored by dorms throughout campus. There are also co-ed intramural events sponsored by Rec-Sports. More information on these events can be found on the Rec-Sports link at the top of the page.

  Bengal Bouts are also a yearly highlight on campus. Men from all dorms gather to train and box one another to raise money for the Holy Cross Missions in Bengladash. Siegfried's own, Dan Rodgers, was victorious in his weight class in 2007, 2008, and 2009. Look for more information on this early in the school year.

  There are also intramural fields located just north of Siegfried. Here students can play anything from football to soccer to ultimate frisbee to sand volleyball.

  We also participate in inter-section two hand touch football and water polo. Sections compete for glory throughout the fall and spring semesters.
